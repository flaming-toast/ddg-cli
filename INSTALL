ddg-cli
A command line interface to DuckDuckGo
Author: jyu <jyu@ftoast.org>

INSTALL GUIDELINES
=====================================

This is a simple perl application composed of three perl scripts (all listed in MANIFEST): 
ddg -- main wrapper script
scripts/results -- screen scraping duckduckgo.com/html for search results
scripts/zci -- query DuckDuckGo's instant answer API


HOW TO INSTALL
======================================
No need to "build anything." Just git clone the repo to your desired directory, or 
download the compressed tar archive from the http://ftoast.org and unpack it. The 
Makefile.PL is there to save you the pain of figuring out dependencies. 

First, Run perl Makefile.PL to figure out missing dependencies (namely, missing perl modules 
needed to run the application. Use cpanm or the like to install the missing modules, 
and you're good to go!)

Second, run configure to set the install base path the script will use. This is necessary. 
Ensure that the scripts maintain their relative locations in the base directory (i.e., don't touch anything.)

Lastly, you may want to modify your PATH variable to include the directory containing the perl scripts 
so you can use the application without referring to its path. 

CONFIGURATION
========================================
Configuration parameters are located and can be modified in ./ddg.conf. 
You may wish to configure the client to display a maximum number of results or set the browser to use when selecting
a search result.
The 'browser' parameter is REQUIRED and the 'max_results' parameter is OPTIONAL. 
If max_results is not set, the client will just display the first page of results.

USING THE APPLICATION
=======================================
General usage:
ddg [-rmb] QUERY
Options will override parameters specified in ddg.conf

To search:
ddg 'query'
Be sure to quote your query. 

To view a result: 
ddg -r <result #>

To override specified browser in ddg.conf
ddg -b 'google-chrome' 'query' # if I want to use google-chrome, for example

To specify max results:
ddg -m 10 'query' # Only 10 search results will be displayed

Don't want to flood your terminal with results? How about usin' a pager:
ddg 'query' | most
ddg 'query' | less # There seems to be text formatting issues with less, beware

Be creative and use pipes/redirection:
ddg -m 10 'query' | grep 'my website' # Let's see if my website is listed in the top 10 results!
ddg 'query' | grep '[use some crazy regex zomg]$&#()!@'
ddg 'query' > results
etc........


VIEWING RESULTS
========================================
When you conduct a search, search results will be labeled numerically so that you can
refer to them and open the link in the specified browser (see ddg.conf).
After running a search, run ddg -r <result #> to access that result in a browser. 
As of this point, the application cannot handle multiple searches (i.e., the -r option will refer 
to your *most recent* search)

BUG REPORTS AND SUCH
========================================
I am no perl monk and I welcome any feedback. If you find any bugs, or have any suggestions (perhaps a better way
of implementing a feature in this application, and whatnot) please shoot me an email at jyu@ftoast.org.

Thanks!
